                Hi, I am Evgenii Bortsov! My key skills are: Python, SQL, git. My journey in learning python began when
                Yandex launched "CodeRun" - a 3 month competition for 5 tracks (I chose the backend track) where the
                participants had to solve a lot of tasks related to the chosen track (backend track contained 54 tasks).
                During the "CodeRun" I was learning Python and SQL as many tasks were aimed on using some API, deploying local
                server or wriging some tricky SQL queries. As a result, I ended on 30th place with 51 solved
                problems. 
                <br>
                I have quite a good skills in creating Telegram Bots and I had lot of experience with library aiogram.
                So far I have only implemented pet-projects, like <a href="https://github.com/ebortsov/simple-image-storage-bot" class="text-link">Image Saver Bot</a>, 
                or <a href="https://github.com/ebortsov/tasker" class="text-link">bot</a> for manaing tasks.
                Also, as a school project, I created a simple <a class="text-link" href="https://strugovatrain.github.io/">website</a> 
                to memorise words, kanji, and kana for the japanese language textbook "Читаем, пишем, говорим по-японски".

                I have over 5+ years experience in competitive programming. My main achievments are:
                <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/limbo16" class="cf-link">highest rating</a> of International Master on Codeforces, 2nd degree diploma on the student olympiad in progamming (one of
                the toughest all-russian competitive programming olympiad). <br> In the university, my team managed to take 2nd
                place on ICPC quarterfinals and get 3rd degree diploma on ICPC semi-finals. Unfortunately, we didn't get to
                the finals. But it's only first-year course so I hope on continue polishing my competitivie programming
                skills along with working on projects.

                In my free time, I enjoy cycling and running. In May 2024, I completed my first half-marathon in 1:55, an event
                that inspired me to work further personal and professional growth. I believe in the value of endeavor,
                appreciating those who work modestly and diligently towards their goals.
