                Hi, I am Evgenii Bortsov! My key skills are Python, SQL, git. My journey in learning python began when
                Yandex launched "CodeRun" - a 3-month competition for 5 tracks (I chose the backend track) where the
                participants had to solve a lot of tasks related to the chosen track (backend track contained 54 tasks).
                During the "CodeRun", I was learning Python and SQL as many tasks were aimed to using some API,
                deploying local server or writing some tricky SQL queries. As a result, I ended on the 30th place with
                51 solved problems.
                <br>
                I have quite good skills in creating Telegram bots and I had a lot of experience with the aiogram
                library.
                So far I have only implemented pet-projects, like <a

                or <a href="https://github.com/ebortsov/tasker" class="text-link">bot</a> for manaing tasks.
                Also as a school project, I created a simple <a class="text-link"
                    href="https://strugovatrain.github.io/">website</a>
                to memorize words, kanji, and kana for the Japanese language textbook "Читаем, пишем, говорим
                по-японски".

                I have over 5+ years experience in competitive programming. My main achievments are:
                <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/limbo16" class="cf-link">highest rating</a> of International
                Master on Codeforces,
                2nd degree diploma on the student Olympiad in programming (one of the toughest all-Russian competitive
                programming Olympiad). <br> In the university, my team managed to take 2nd place on ICPC quarterfinals
                and get 3rd degree diploma on ICPC semifinals. Unfortunately, we didn't get to the finals. But I am only
                first-year student, so I hope on continue polishing my competitive programming skills along with working
                on my projects.

                Currently, I am studying on the first course of Innopolis University on the track "Data analysis and
                Artificial Intelligence". As a part of Software Course, I work in a team on developing Telegram Bot for
                calculating Zakat - a special type of payment for wealthy Muslims.

                In my free time, I enjoy cycling and running. In May 2024, I completed my first half-marathon in 1:55,
                an event that inspired me to work further personal and professional growth. I believe in the value of
                endeavor, appreciating those who work modestly and diligently towards their goals
